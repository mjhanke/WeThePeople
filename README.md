# WeThePeople

## Getting Started 

To run the iOS app:

Navigate to the "frontend" folder and do:

```bash
brew install yarn
yarn install
cd ios/
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod install
open WeThePeople.xcworkspace
cd ..
yarn start
brew cask install fastlane
export PATH="$HOME/.fastlane/bin:$PATH"
match init
```

There will be an error in one of the React files. Change "RCTAnimation/" to "React/". 

Sorry about the hack.
